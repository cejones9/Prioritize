1]Fix priority alrogithm output (cody)

2]Make Syncing 100% Stable (cody)

3]Change Reminder Creation to an Activity to Activity strategy.  Date Picker activity (lets allow the user to pick 3 separate dates, 
each date needs to higher than the previous, we can verify this by the save button, if a date does not follow rule then save does 
nothing but alert the user to the rule), then 1 activity for typing Description and marking the checkboxes and choosing the priority value. 

4]Change priority picker to something else

5]Add calendar activity that has markings on due dates

6]EditReminder: Because we’re changing the way we create the reminder we need to change this strategy. My Suggestion for this is 
to have an onlick listener for the listview, much like the onlong click. Except onclick we simply go to a new activity that 
displays all of the information about that particular entry via:
Description: display in an edit text box. 
Due Date (1): onclick go to datepicker activity. (preset to currentvalue)
Due Time (1); onclick go to Timepicker Activity (preset to currentvalue)
Due Date (2): same strategy but we will display dates 2-3 only if they exist, we can check this from sql, i will make that query.
Due Time(2): same strategy as stated above:
Priority Picker preset to currentvalue
Checkboxes prest to currentvalue
Repeat value preset to currentvalue: note if more than 1 date is selected, we will simply not allow the user to repeat, finding 
a repeatable pattern for multiple dates isn’t as important as anything else.
